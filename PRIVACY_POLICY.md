# Randomator: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Randomator app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by AlFonz.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data can simply be erased by uninstalling the app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please contact me, and I will do my best to resolve the matter.

Yours sincerely,  
AlFonz
